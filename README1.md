# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand what factors influenced passenger survival.
The goal is to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Dataset
Dataset: Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)  
File used: `titanic.csv`

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded dataset using Pandas  
2. Cleaned missing values  
3. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Visualized survival patterns  
5. Derived insights from data  

## Key Insights
- Females had higher survival rate than males  
- First class passengers survived more  
- Younger passengers had better survival chance  

## How to Run
1. Download the repository  
2. Open Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run `titanic_analysis.ipynb`  

## Output
Graphs and insights are displayed in the notebook.
